/// Example (Comparison):
///
///     title: "Summary size limit"
///     description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
///     expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"
///
/// Example (Equality):
///
///     title: "Requestor is owner"
///     description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
///     expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"
///
/// Example (Logic):
///
///     title: "Public documents"
///     description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
///     expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
///
/// Example (Data Manipulation):
///
///     title: "Notification string"
///     description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
///     expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"
